# Progress

## Milestones

- **Initial Setup**: Project scaffolded using Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.
- **Visual Foundation**: Hero section, sky backdrop, Milky Way HD image integration, shooting stars, and ambient star twinkle implemented.
- **Interactivity**: Homepage interaction added with interactive Lucky Pick card reveal (6/7 picks), dynamic color and day selection logic, tip jar, and gift package.
- **Payment & Cloud Integration**: Added Stripe checkout support and email handling configuration logic.
- **Mobile Performance Phase 1**: Addressed LCP delays, optimized heavy hero images to WEBP, corrected fetch priorities, eliminated endless cache busting, and handled 500 errors gracefully with Upstash.
- **Mobile Performance Phase 2**: Eliminated render-blocking CSS logic in `layout.js` by reverting to Next.js CSS asset bundling. Dynamically imported Howler.js (`audio.js`) only upon user click interactions, removing 41 KiB of unused JS from the initial page load.
- **Security & Reliability Phase 1**: Resolved intermittent Turnstile loading issues, fixed Gift Experience pricing inconsistencies, implemented distributed rate limiting via Upstash Redis, and fortified the gift delivery webhook/GET route integration against race conditions.

## Completed Tasks

- Integrated Cloudflare Turnstile into public forms.
- Replaced the hardcoded 'crypto.randomUUID()' in `app/layout.js` styles path with the stable Next.js build ID/commit hash, resolving unstable style reloads.
- Reduced unused JavaScript and render-blocking CSS warnings in Lighthouse/PageSpeed audits for the mobile configuration.
- Refactored `TurnstileField` to use `next/script` for reliable initialization.
- Secured rate-limiting paths using distributed Redis state.
