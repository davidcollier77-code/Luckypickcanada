# PR Summary — Gemini PR-Agent Workflow Repair

## TASK ROUTING

- **SELECTED TASK GROUP**: troubleshooting
- **GROUP REASON**: Repair an existing automated review workflow that has malformed step configuration and selects the wrong model, while preserving unrelated automation.

## GOVERNANCE AND EXECUTION METHOD

- Root `AGENTS.md` was read first.
- Spec Kit stage definitions were read and used in file-driven procedural execution because native Jules slash-command dispatch and a repository shell checkout were unavailable in this session.
- **Specify**: `.jules/cmds/speckit.specify.md`; method: FILE-DRIVEN PROCEDURAL EXECUTION; result: artifacts updated under `.specify/features/034-pr-agent/`.
- **Plan**: `.jules/cmds/speckit.plan.md`; method: FILE-DRIVEN PROCEDURAL EXECUTION; result: task-scoped implementation and verification plan updated.
- **Tasks**: `.jules/cmds/speckit.tasks.md`; method: FILE-DRIVEN PROCEDURAL EXECUTION; result: ordered implementation and remaining verification tasks updated.
- **Implement**: `.jules/cmds/speckit.implement.md`; method: FILE-DRIVEN PROCEDURAL EXECUTION; result: workflow correction and regression test authored through the GitHub repository API. Local tests could not run here.
- `.specify/feature.json` continues to point at the active feature `.specify/features/034-pr-agent`.

## REQUIRED LIBRARIES

- **LIBRARY**: The-PR-Agent/pr-agent
  - **VERSION**: `fbf7f6d3fcff6d9bf15aef7d8f4a6c2cacc7ad1f`
  - **USED**: YES
  - **USEFUL**: YES
  - **REASON**: The existing pinned action is retained; its expected step-level environment configuration was compared with the malformed repository workflow.
- **LIBRARY**: Vitest
  - **VERSION**: Existing project dependency `^5.0.0`
  - **USED**: YES
  - **USEFUL**: YES
  - **REASON**: Used as the existing test harness for the new static workflow regression test; no dependency was added or changed.
- No dependency was added, upgraded, or removed.

## REQUIRED ROUTED JULES / GEMINI DOCUMENTS

- **DOCUMENT**: `.docs/troubleshooting/jules_google_docs.md`
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: NO
  - **REASON**: Consulted as required troubleshooting-group reference; it covers Jules CLI operation, not GitHub Actions step configuration.
- **DOCUMENT**: `.docs/troubleshooting/developers_google_com_jules_api.md`
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: NO
  - **REASON**: Consulted as required standing reference; its REST source APIs do not affect this workflow repair.
- **DOCUMENT**: `.docs/troubleshooting/_google-gemini_gemini-cli.md`
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: NO
  - **REASON**: Consulted as required troubleshooting-group reference; Gemini CLI usage does not configure PR-Agent's GitHub Action.
- **DOCUMENT**: `.docs/troubleshooting/_websites_ai_google_dev_gemini-api.md`
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: YES
  - **REASON**: Consulted the local Google Gemini API snapshot; it establishes the repository-routed provider reference. Current model identifier was also checked against the official model documentation recorded in the research file.
- **DOCUMENT**: `.docs/troubleshooting/_github_docs.md`
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: YES
  - **REASON**: Supplied the repository-routed reference for GitHub Actions, secrets, and workflow behavior.
- **DOCUMENT**: `.docs/manifest.json`
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: YES
  - **REASON**: Verified the required troubleshooting-group documentation inventory.
- **DOCUMENT**: Official PR-Agent GitHub installation/configuration documentation — https://docs.pr-agent.ai/installation/github/
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: YES
  - **REASON**: Confirmed the provider variable belongs in the action step's `env` map.
- **DOCUMENT**: Official Google Gemini API models documentation — https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: YES
  - **REASON**: Checked the intended Gemini model name.

## REPOSITORY COMPONENTS CONSULTED

- **COMPONENT**: `.github/workflows/pr-agent.yml`
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: YES
  - **REASON**: Confirmed settings were indented below `uses:` without an `env:` section and that the wrong Gemini model was selected.
- **COMPONENT**: PR #1527 merge diff
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: YES
  - **REASON**: Traced the incorrect workflow back to the implementation merged into `main`.
- **COMPONENT**: `.specify/features/034-pr-agent/`
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: YES
  - **REASON**: Existing active Spec Kit feature; used for specification, plan, research, task, checklist, and quickstart records.
- **COMPONENT**: `.github/workflows/visual-qa.yml` and `.github/workflows/validate-open-next-repair.yml`
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: YES
  - **REASON**: Identified the CI test, TypeScript, governance, Playwright, OpenNext, Wrangler, and 495 MiB verification paths.
- **COMPONENT**: `package.json`
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: YES
  - **REASON**: Verified Node.js/pnpm context, the existing Vitest dependency, and available scripts.
- **COMPONENT**: Memory Bank
  - **USED**: YES; **USEFUL**: YES
  - **REASON**: Updated current repository context and progress without removing existing records.

## IMPLEMENTATION, BOUNDARIES, AND REMAINING ISSUES

- Fixed step-level workflow structure, selected `gemini/gemini-3.8-flash`, aligned the GitHub Actions and PR-Agent event filters, removed the bot-sender exclusion, added a credential-presence preflight, and configured Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite as the fallback while keeping Gemini 3.8 Flash primary.
- Kept the pinned PR-Agent action, existing GitHub permissions, and review-only behavior. Auto description and auto improvement remain disabled.
- No changes to CodeRabbit, Amazon Q, Robin retirement, API routes, app UI, dependencies, deployment workflows, or the secret value.
- **Secret status: UNKNOWN** — GitHub repository secret values and secret existence cannot be queried through the available interface. The new preflight will confirm availability on a workflow run.
- **Live reviewer status: NOT YET VERIFIED** — the first PR-Agent run passed preflight and attempted `gemini/gemini-3.8-flash`, but Google returned HTTP 503 `UNAVAILABLE` with a temporary high-demand message. PR-Agent then attempted the unrelated default `gpt-5.6-terra` fallback, which failed because no usable OpenAI key is configured. The workflow now falls back to Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite and does not use the unrelated default OpenAI model. A successful review is still required.
- A local checkout attempt failed because the execution environment could not resolve `github.com`. Local shell-based tests/build/governance checks are therefore not claimed.
- **Scope authorization**: user explicitly authorized direct implementation and a new PR. The change only consumes the intended existing secret; it does not create or modify any secret.

## VERIFICATION RESULTS

- **COMMAND**: `pnpm exec vitest run __tests__/pr-agent-workflow.test.js`
  - **RESULT**: PASS (within the full test suite)
  - **EVIDENCE/OUTPUT SUMMARY**: The updated regression file completed 4 tests successfully.
- **COMMAND**: `pnpm run test`
  - **RESULT**: PASS
  - **EVIDENCE/OUTPUT SUMMARY**: Current completed CI run reported 14 test files passed and 91 tests passed.
- **COMMAND**: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`
  - **RESULT**: PASS
  - **EVIDENCE/OUTPUT SUMMARY**: TypeScript check completed successfully in Visual QA run 39276675079.
- **COMMAND**: `./jules-verify.sh`
  - **RESULT**: FAIL ON THE LAST RUN; FIX COMMITTED
  - **EVIDENCE/OUTPUT SUMMARY**: Verifier stopped because `.specify/feature.json` still pointed to the previously active Crystal Ball task. This commit updates the pointer to `.specify/features/034-pr-agent`; a current-head rerun is required.
- **COMMAND**: `pnpm exec playwright test`
  - **RESULT**: PENDING CURRENT-HEAD CI
  - **EVIDENCE/OUTPUT SUMMARY**: Visual QA stopped at the governance gate in run 39276675079, before Playwright ran.
- **COMMAND**: OpenNext build and measured `.next + public` size check (495 MiB hard limit)
  - **RESULT**: PASS
  - **EVIDENCE/OUTPUT SUMMARY**: Validate OpenNext run 39276675103 passed Next.js build and the explicit 495 MiB size gate. Its current final outcome must still be verified for full OpenNext/Wrangler validation.
- **COMMAND**: Live Gemini review
  - **RESULT**: FAILED TRANSIENTLY; RETRY REQUIRED
  - **EVIDENCE/OUTPUT SUMMARY**: The credential preflight passed; PR-Agent attempted the documented `gemini/gemini-3.8-flash` primary model twice and received HTTP 503 `UNAVAILABLE` (high demand). The prior unrelated OpenAI fallback was removed; Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite is now the fallback. A visible review is still not confirmed.

## PRE-SUBMISSION DOUBLE-CHECK

The source workflow, test assertions, Spec Kit artifacts, and proposed file list were cross-checked against the focused scope. The changed-file list above is the intended complete set. Final current-head GitHub diff and CI results must be inspected after PR creation before treating implementation as verified.

**USEFUL RESULT**: NO — implementation is prepared in the PR; runtime success remains dependent on actual CI and a credentialed live review.
